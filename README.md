Due Date

Actions (✏ Edit / 🗑 Delete)



4. Use the Filter dropdown to show tasks by status.


5. Use the Search bar to find tasks by description.

✅ Example Workflow

Add a task: "Finish project report", status: Active, priority: High Priority, due date: 2025-09-25.

Edit task later if needed.

Mark as Completed once done.

Search “report” in the search bar to quickly find it.

Delete tasks you don’t need anymore.
